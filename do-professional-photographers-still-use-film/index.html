</center> <p><strong>Do Professional Photographers Still Use Film</strong>, The benefit here is that film photographers have to consider every shot. If you use film, you know the quality of the picture is second to none, you think about each shot and you are not using your camera like a machine gun, hoping for 10% being good. The results you get, however, are infinitely better.</p>

If you want to spend hours or days behind the computer playing to get the perfect picture, you can still have your film pictures put on disc.

Photographers still control their work by manipulating the holy trinity of exposure: The benefit here is that film photographers have to consider every shot.
