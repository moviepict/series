<p>I would not let a 10 1/2 year old read these books. In short, the twilight series makes for some great bonding time with your girls. I would recommend this series for girls ages 13 and up , simply because the themes of love, physical involvement, and violence are more suitable for teens than for tweens. I should mention that there are many more movies which i think someone should have seen by the age of 11 (like �star wars� or �the lion king�), but which are not on here because they are rated for a different age bracket.</p>
