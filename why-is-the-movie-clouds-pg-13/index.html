<p>New Ghostbusters Movie Age Rating, The film contains macabre and suggestive jokes and nonperilous action sequences.

<p>Just Wright Movie Review, If the violence is more frequent or realistic this warrants the pg13 rating. The trailers showed a preview of the balance between the violent action and comedic dynamic of the characters, and these elements are expected to carry over into the final cut of the film. It completely lacks any blood of gore, except for a brief part where sephiroth.</p>
<h3 id="the-film-contains-macabre-and-suggestive-jokes-and-nonperilous-action-sequences">The film contains macabre and suggestive jokes and nonperilous action sequences.</h3><p>A young man sings “i’m sexy and i know it” and gyrates suggestively. A male character is seen shirtless, wrapped in a sheet in a religious ceremony. Although most of the violence is bloodless a lot of the carnage is very stressful and brutal in a sense mainly knowing that people were either burned, drowned, shot, or crushed. Titanic is a perfect example of this. For a movie to be considered g it must have no more than light cartoonish violence.</p>
