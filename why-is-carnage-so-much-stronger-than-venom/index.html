<p>Who is stronger in just strength, Venom or Carnage? Quora, Because kasady is evil he synchronizes with the symbiont at a greater level then venom.

When carnage was born sure he was stronger.</p>

<p>Venom 3 Could See Venom &amp; MCU’s SpiderMan Team Up to, He bonded with scorpion and flash and all the guardians of the glaxy so he has their powers so he is basicly stronger cause carnage only bonded with cletus. Specifically, the alien found its way into cletus through a cut in his hand. Personally i think carnage is better because he has a lot more power than venom and he.</p>

Carnage was the start of too many villains with the symbiote. The idea that he would become stronger after eating carnage seems to come from an idea that he would be absorbing carnage�s symbiote powers and properties into himself, therefore becoming stronger..</p>
<h3 id="so-carnage-using-the-generation-rule-is-more-powerful-than-venom">So carnage, using the generation rule is more powerful than venom.</h3><p>Because to an extent, venom is kind of afraid of carnage on the books too, or at least seems to be in modern books. As a result, carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than venom. Another reason is because carnage bonded with his host through the blood stream, so this means that carnage can do more for its host, for example cletus has a stronger healing factor, Why should we care about any of this?
